- `teams` - Project teams within organizations
- `team_members` - Team membership and permissions
- `projects` - Main project entities

### Messaging System (Migration 002)
- `conversations` - Chat conversations and channels
- `conversation_participants` - User participation in conversations
- `messages` - Individual messages with threading support
- `message_reactions` - Message reactions and emoji responses
- `notifications` - System notifications and alerts

### File Management (Migration 003)
- `project_members` - Project-specific user roles
- `project_milestones` - Project deadlines and milestones
- `files` - File storage metadata and versioning
- `file_permissions` - Granular file access control

### Business Operations (Migration 004)
- `invoices` - Billing and payment tracking
- `time_entries` - Time tracking for billable work
- `service_packages` - Service offerings and pricing
- `client_requests` - Lead management and intake
- `portfolios` - User portfolio management
- `portfolio_items` - Portfolio project showcases

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Database Setup ✅
- [x] Install PostgreSQL dependencies
- [x] Configure database connection pooling
- [x] Create migration system
- [x] Set up backup utilities
- [x] Test database connectivity

### Phase 2: Schema Migration
- [ ] Run migration 001 (Core tables)
- [ ] Run migration 002 (Messaging system)
- [ ] Run migration 003 (File management)
- [ ] Run migration 004 (Business operations)
- [ ] Verify schema integrity

### Phase 3: Data Migration
- [ ] Export existing file-based data
- [ ] Transform data to PostgreSQL format
- [ ] Import user accounts and organizations
- [ ] Migrate project data and relationships
- [ ] Import message history
- [ ] Migrate file references and permissions

### Phase 4: Application Integration
- [ ] Update server-auth.js to use PostgreSQL
- [ ] Update server-messaging.js for database backend
- [ ] Modify file upload handlers
- [ ] Update frontend API calls
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations

### Phase 5: Production Deployment
- [ ] Create production database
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Deploy with zero downtime
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Rollback plan if needed

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups
- **Daily**: Full database dump at 2 AM UTC
- **Hourly**: Incremental backups during business hours
- **Pre-migration**: Full backup before any schema changes
- **Pre-deployment**: Production snapshot before releases

### Backup Retention
- Daily backups: 30 days
- Weekly backups: 12 weeks
- Monthly backups: 12 months
- Annual backups: 5 years

### Backup Storage
- Primary: Local server storage
- Secondary: AWS S3 encrypted backups
- Offsite: Encrypted backups to separate geographic region

### Recovery Testing
- Monthly backup restoration tests
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills
- Annual full system recovery validation

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Loss Prevention
- Transaction-based migrations
- Rollback scripts for each migration
- Data validation checksums
- Multiple backup copies

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexing strategy
- Connection pooling optimization
- Query performance monitoring
- Resource usage alerts

### Security Measures
- Database access control
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Regular security audits
- Credential rotation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Database connection testing
- Migration script validation
- Data integrity checks
- Performance benchmarks

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing
- File upload/download workflows
- User authentication flows
- Real-time messaging tests

### Load Testing
- Concurrent user simulations
- Database performance under load
- Message throughput testing
- File operation stress tests

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Database Metrics
- Connection pool utilization
- Query execution times
- Table size growth
- Index usage statistics

### Application Metrics
- API response times
- Error rates by endpoint
- User session metrics
- File operation metrics

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Server resource usage
- Network latency
- Disk space utilization
- Backup completion status

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 15 minutes)
1. Stop application servers
2. Restore previous application version
3. Switch to file-based storage
4. Restart services
5. Verify functionality

### Full Rollback (< 1 hour)
1. Create current state backup
2. Restore pre-migration database
3. Restore application code
4. Verify data integrity
5. Notify stakeholders

## Success Criteria

### Performance Targets
- API response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Database query time < 50ms (average)
- File upload speed > 10MB/s
- Message delivery latency < 100ms

### Reliability Targets
- 99.9% uptime during migration
- Zero data loss tolerance
- < 10 minute downtime window
- Successful rollback capability

### User Experience
- No functionality regression
- Improved search performance
- Real-time features working
- Mobile responsiveness maintained

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Test database connection
node database/test-connection.js

# Initialize schema (development only)
node database/test-connection.js --init-schema

# Run migrations
node database/test-connection.js --migrate

# Create backup
node database/test-connection.js --backup

# Full test suite
npm test

# Performance test
npm run test:performance
```

## Post-Migration Tasks
