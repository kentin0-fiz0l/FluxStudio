node tests/run-all-tests.js --skip-load           # Skip load tests
node tests/run-all-tests.js --skip-integration    # Skip integration tests
node tests/run-all-tests.js --security           # Include security tests

# Run individual test suites
npx mocha tests/integration/sprint9.integration.test.js --timeout 60000
node tests/load/performance.load.test.js
```

### Test Configuration
**File:** `tests/test.config.js`

Centralized configuration for:
- Server endpoints and timeouts
- Load test parameters
- Performance thresholds
- Security test parameters
- Test data and utilities

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Server Connection Errors**
```
❌ Auth Server is not accessible: ECONNREFUSED
```
**Solution:** Ensure auth server is running on port 3001
```bash
USE_DATABASE=true node server-auth.js
```

**2. WebSocket Connection Failures**
```
❌ WebSocket connection error: timeout
```
**Solution:** Check firewall settings and ensure WebSocket support is enabled

**3. File Upload Timeouts**
```
❌ Upload timeout after 30000ms
```
**Solution:** Increase timeout in test configuration or check disk space

**4. Database Connection Issues**
```
❌ Database query error: connection refused
```
**Solution:** Ensure PostgreSQL is running and database exists

### Performance Thresholds

The test suite validates against these performance benchmarks:

| Metric | Threshold | Current |

## 🔄 Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test file in appropriate directory
2. Follow naming convention: `feature.test-type.test.js`
3. Use shared test configuration from `test.config.js`
4. Update this README with coverage information

### Updating Thresholds
Edit performance thresholds in `tests/test.config.js`:
```javascript
performance: {
  api: { maxResponseTime: 500 },
  database: { maxQueryTime: 100 }
}
```

### Test Data Management
Test data is automatically generated and cleaned up. For persistent test data, use the `testData` configuration in `test.config.js`.
