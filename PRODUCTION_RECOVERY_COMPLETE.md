# FluxStudio Production Recovery - COMPLETE

## Issue Summary

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Severity**: Critical (Production Outage)
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Status**: RESOLVED

### Root Cause

The deployment script used `rsync --delete` which removed all backend files from the production server, including:
- Backend server files (server-auth.js, server-messaging.js, server-collaboration.js)
- Critical dependency directories (config/, middleware/, monitoring/, lib/, database/)
- Configuration files (package.json, .env)
- Node modules (partially deleted)

### Impact

- All backend API services returning 502 Bad Gateway errors
- PM2 services crashing immediately on startup (exit code 0)
- Frontend deployed successfully but unable to communicate with backend
- Complete loss of API functionality

## Recovery Actions Taken

### 1. Diagnosis (15 minutes)

Identified the issue through systematic investigation:
```bash
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "cd /var/www/fluxstudio && ls -la"
# Found: Backend directories missing

ssh root@167.172.208.61 "cd /var/www/fluxstudio && pm2 logs"
# Found: Services starting then immediately disconnecting

ssh root@167.172.208.61 "cd /var/www/fluxstudio && node server-auth.js"
# Found: "Cannot find module 'dotenv'"
```

### 2. Backend Dependencies Recovery (20 minutes)

Created and executed emergency recovery script:
```bash
./scripts/emergency-backend-recovery.sh
```

This script:
- Uploaded config/ directory (1 file)
- Uploaded middleware/ directory (2 files)
- Uploaded monitoring/ directory (8 files)
- Uploaded lib/ directory (28 files)
- Uploaded database/ directory (19 files)
- Uploaded health-check.js
- Verified all critical directories present on server

### 3. Node Modules Recovery (45 minutes)

Initial `npm install` failed due to:
- Dependency conflicts (date-fns version mismatch)
- Node version mismatch (server has Node 18, some packages require Node 20)
- Memory constraints on server

**Solution**: Upload pre-built node_modules from local machine
```bash
# Created tarball of working local node_modules (140MB)
tar -czf /tmp/fluxstudio-node-modules.tar.gz node_modules/

# Uploaded to server
scp /tmp/fluxstudio-node-modules.tar.gz root@167.172.208.61:/var/www/fluxstudio/

# Extracted on server
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "cd /var/www/fluxstudio && rm -rf node_modules && tar -xzf fluxstudio-node-modules.tar.gz"
```

### 4. Production Configuration (10 minutes)

Uploaded correct production .env file:
```bash
scp .env.production root@167.172.208.61:/var/www/fluxstudio/.env
```

### 5. Service Restart and Verification (15 minutes)

Restarted all PM2 services:
```bash
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "cd /var/www/fluxstudio && pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --env production"
```

Verified all services healthy:
```bash
curl localhost:3001/health  # Auth service ✓
curl localhost:3004/health  # Messaging service ✓
curl localhost:4000/health  # Collaboration service ✓
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Safe Deployment Script

Created `/Users/kentino/FluxStudio/scripts/safe-deploy-production.sh` which:
- ✅ Never uses `rsync --delete`
- ✅ Preserves node_modules, logs, and data directories
- ✅ Includes pre-deployment verification
- ✅ Includes post-deployment health checks
- ✅ Provides rollback instructions
- ✅ Has comprehensive error handling

### 2. Emergency Recovery Script

Created `/Users/kentino/FluxStudio/scripts/emergency-backend-recovery.sh` for rapid recovery:
- Restores all backend directories
- Verifies uploads
- Offers multiple node_modules installation strategies
- Provides step-by-step guidance

### 3. Deployment Checklist

**Before Deployment:**
- [ ] Run `npm run build` locally
- [ ] Verify build completed successfully
- [ ] Backup current production state (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Review changes being deployed

**During Deployment:**
- [ ] Use `safe-deploy-production.sh` script
- [ ] Monitor upload progress
- [ ] Verify files uploaded correctly
- [ ] Check PM2 service status

**After Deployment:**
- [ ] Test all health endpoints
- [ ] Verify frontend loads correctly
- [ ] Test critical user flows
- [ ] Monitor PM2 logs for errors
- [ ] Check application metrics

## Technical Learnings

### 1. rsync --delete is dangerous in production
- **Problem**: Deletes files not present in source
- **Solution**: Use selective includes or avoid --delete flag
- **Best Practice**: Create deployment package with only necessary files

### 2. Node modules should be pre-built or cached
- **Problem**: npm install on production can fail due to memory/network/version issues
- **Solution**: Upload pre-built node_modules or use Docker containers
- **Best Practice**: Use CI/CD with dependency caching

### 3. Critical directories must be protected
The following directories should NEVER be deleted during deployment:
- `node_modules/` - Runtime dependencies
- `logs/` - Historical logs for debugging
- `uploads/` - User-uploaded files
- `*.json` files (users.json, teams.json, etc.) - File-based database

### 4. Health checks are essential
- Every service should have a /health endpoint
- Deployment scripts should verify health before completion
- PM2 should be configured with health check timeouts

### 5. Environment configuration matters
- Production .env must match production requirements
- `USE_DATABASE=true` with missing database causes silent failures
- `NODE_ENV=production` affects behavior of many packages

## Scripts Reference

### Deployment
```bash
# Safe deployment (RECOMMENDED)
./scripts/safe-deploy-production.sh

# Emergency recovery (if deployment goes wrong)
./scripts/emergency-backend-recovery.sh
```

### Service Management
```bash
# Check service status
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "cd /var/www/fluxstudio && pm2 status"

# View logs
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "cd /var/www/fluxstudio && pm2 logs"

# Restart services
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "cd /var/www/fluxstudio && pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --env production"

# Stop services
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "cd /var/www/fluxstudio && pm2 stop all"
```

### Health Checks
```bash
# From server (direct)
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "curl localhost:3001/health"
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "curl localhost:3004/health"
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "curl localhost:4000/health"
