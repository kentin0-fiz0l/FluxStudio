# Security Incident Response - Exposed Credentials in Git History

## Executive Summary

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Status**: üü° ACTIVE - Awaiting Cleanup Execution
**Severity**: üî¥ HIGH
**Issue**: Production credentials exposed in git repository history

---

## Incident Overview

### What Happened

The file `.env.production` containing production credentials was committed to the git repository on **October 11, 2025** in commit `398c28746eea1ae2bbcd7d37ed3fe5527c56ebeb`.

### Exposed Credentials

The following sensitive information was exposed in git history:

- **Database Credentials**
  - PostgreSQL password
  - MongoDB password and connection string
  - Redis password

- **Authentication Secrets**
  - JWT_SECRET
  - JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
  - Session secrets

- **OAuth Credentials**
  - Google OAuth client secret
  - GitHub OAuth client secret

- **Third-Party Services**
  - SMTP credentials
  - Grafana admin password
  - OpenAI API keys
  - Stripe secret keys

- **Infrastructure**
  - AWS credentials (if configured)
  - API endpoints with embedded credentials

### Impact Assessment

**Confidentiality**: HIGH
- All production credentials exposed
- Git history is distributed (copies may exist locally on team members' machines)
- Commit is in repository but not yet pushed to public remote

**Integrity**: LOW
- No evidence of credential misuse detected
- No unauthorized access attempts observed

**Availability**: NONE
- No service disruption

### Current Risk Level: HIGH

**Why HIGH**:
- Credentials exist in git history (permanent record)
- Multiple systems affected
- Potential for complete system compromise if exploited
- Git history is distributed to all developers
