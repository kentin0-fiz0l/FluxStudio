## üéØ Critical Findings Summary

### üî¥ BLOCKERS (Must Fix Immediately)
1. **7 critical security vulnerabilities** - NOT production-ready
   - No JWT refresh (tokens can't be revoked)
   - OAuth credentials exposed in git
   - 9 XSS vulnerabilities
   - No MFA
   - Weak password policy
   - Rate limiting in-memory
   - WebSocket not authenticated

2. **Real-time collaboration not implemented** - Core feature missing
   - Yjs libraries installed but ZERO integration
   - Architecture designed but not built

3. **Test suite broken** - Can't safely deploy
   - Infinite loop detected
   - Blocks regression testing

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Competitive Disadvantages)
4. **Overwhelming onboarding** - 5 steps vs. competitors' 1-2
5. **No bulk file operations** - Deal-breaker for teams
6. **Missing visual comparison** - Table stakes for design tools
7. **No production monitoring** - Flying blind
8. **Accessibility non-compliant** - Blocks enterprise sales

## üö® Critical Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT Deploy to Production Until:
- [ ] All 7 critical security vulnerabilities fixed
- [ ] Third-party security audit passed
- [ ] JWT refresh tokens implemented

**Why:** Current security posture is 5/10 (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK). A breach would be catastrophic.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT Skip Security Sprint (Weeks 1-2)
Even if it delays features. Security is **NON-NEGOTIABLE**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO Test with Real Users Early
- Week 8: Start private beta (20 users)
- Week 10: Expand to 50 users
- Week 12: Public beta launch
