# Sprint 2: Executive Summary
**Task Management UI & Real-Time Collaboration**

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Status**: Planning Complete - Ready to Execute
**Duration**: 2 weeks (October 21 - November 1, 2025)

---

## The Vision

Transform Flux Studio from a basic project tracker into a competitive, real-time project management platform where teams can collaborate seamlessly on tasks, see updates instantly, and work together efficiently.

**One-Line Pitch**: "Build a Kanban board users will love, with real-time collaboration that just works."

---

## What We're Building

### Core Features (Must Have)

**1. Task Management UI**
- Kanban board with drag-and-drop
- List view with sorting and filtering
- Task detail modal with full editing capabilities
- WCAG 2.1 Level A accessible throughout

**2. Real-Time Collaboration**
- WebSocket-powered live updates
- User presence indicators (who's online)
- Typing indicators in comments
- Instant task status changes across all users

**3. Comments & Activity**
- Task comments with @mentions
- Project activity feed
- Real-time notifications
- Comment history and editing

**4. Advanced Features**
- Full-text search across tasks
- Multi-filter combinations
- Saved filter presets
- Shareable filtered views (URL state)

---

## Why This Matters

**User Impact**:

---

## Sprint Deliverables

### Week 1: Task UI Foundation
**Days 1-5**: Build the core task management interface

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] TaskListView component (table with inline editing)
- [ ] KanbanBoard component (drag-and-drop)
- [ ] TaskDetailModal (full task editor with rich text)
- [ ] useTasks hook (React Query integration)
- [ ] All accessibility features (keyboard nav, screen reader)

**Success Metric**: Users can create, view, and update tasks in multiple views

---

### Week 2: Real-Time & Polish
**Days 6-10**: Add collaboration features and polish

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] WebSocket rooms per project
- [ ] Real-time task updates across users
- [ ] User presence tracking
- [ ] Comments system with @mentions
- [ ] Activity feed with infinite scroll
- [ ] Search and advanced filtering

**Success Metric**: Multiple users can collaborate on tasks in real-time

---

## Technical Highlights

### Already Have (Sprint 1)
- Task API (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE endpoints)
- WebSocket server (socket.io)
- Messaging infrastructure
- Validation middleware (71 tests passing)
- Accessibility framework (WCAG 2.1 Level A)

### Building This Sprint
- React components (Kanban, List, Modal)
- Real-time collaboration logic
- Comments API and UI
- Activity tracking system
- Advanced filtering and search

### Preparing For (Sprint 3+)
- PostgreSQL schema design
- Migration scripts (dual-write strategy)
- Data integrity validation

---

## Risk Management

### Critical Risks

**1. Real-Time Conflicts** (HIGH)
- **Risk**: Two users edit same task simultaneously → data loss
- **Mitigation**: Version tracking, conflict detection, user notifications
- **Status**: Solution designed, ready to implement

**2. Performance at Scale** (MEDIUM)
- **Risk**: Slow UI with 100+ tasks
- **Mitigation**: Virtual scrolling, pagination, memoization
- **Status**: Strategy defined, libraries selected

**3. Accessibility of Drag-and-Drop** (MEDIUM)
- **Risk**: Kanban not keyboard accessible → compliance issue
- **Mitigation**: Use @dnd-kit (accessibility-first), test thoroughly
- **Status**: Library chosen, testing plan ready

### Mitigation Status: 🟢 All risks have clear solutions

---

## Resource Requirements

### Team
- **Frontend Developer**: Full-time (Days 1-10)
- **Backend Developer**: 50% time (Days 1-3, 6-7)
- **Tech Lead**: Reviews and guidance (10% time)
- **QA/Accessibility**: Testing (Days 9-10)

### Infrastructure
- **Existing**: WebSocket server, staging environment
- **New This Sprint**: None (use existing JSON storage)
- **Future (Sprint 3)**: PostgreSQL database

### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: Sprint 1 API must be deployed
- **Optional**: PostgreSQL setup (can defer to Sprint 3)

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What if Sprint 1 API isn't deployed on time?**
A: We can work with mock data for Week 1, but must have real API by Week 2 for WebSocket integration.

**Q: Can we add Gantt chart in this sprint?**
A: No, Gantt is planned for Sprint 3. Focus on core task management first.

**Q: What if performance targets aren't met?**
A: We have fallbacks: virtual scrolling, pagination, reduced animations. Performance is monitored daily.

**Q: How do we handle WebSocket failures?**
A: Graceful degradation: fall back to polling API every 5 seconds if WebSocket disconnects.

**Q: Is this sprint too ambitious?**
A: We've scoped carefully. P3 features are "nice-to-have" and can be deferred. Core P1/P2 features are achievable.
