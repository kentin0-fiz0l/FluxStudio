### Overall Security Score: **5/10 (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK)**

**Status:** **NOT PRODUCTION-READY** - Critical vulnerabilities must be fixed immediately.

### Security Assessment by Category

| Category | Score | Status | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Authentication & Authorization | 4/10 | 🔴 Critical gaps | P0 |
| API Security | 6/10 | 🟡 High issues | P1 |
| Data Protection | 5/10 | 🟡 High issues | P1-P2 |
| Real-time Communication | 6/10 | 🟡 Medium issues | P2 |
| Infrastructure Security | 7/10 | 🟢 Minor issues | P2 |
| Application Security | 7/10 | 🟡 High issues | P1 |

### Critical Security Issues (P0 - Deployment Blockers)

#### 1. JWT Tokens Have No Refresh Mechanism
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Location:** `server-auth.js:325-331`

**Current Implementation:**
```javascript
function generateToken(user) {
  return jwt.sign(
    { id: user.id, email: user.email, userType: user.userType },
    JWT_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '7d' } // 7-day tokens - NO REFRESH
  );
}
```

**Security Impact:**
- Compromised tokens remain valid for 7 days
- No server-side revocation capability
- Users cannot logout from all devices
- Password change doesn't invalidate existing sessions

**Recommended Fix:**
- Implement 15-minute access tokens + 7-day refresh tokens
- Store refresh tokens in database with revocation capability
- Add `/api/auth/refresh` and `/api/auth/revoke` endpoints
- Implement session tracking table

**BUT with Creative Vision consideration (from Sprint 12):**
```typescript
// Activity-based token extension for creative sessions
const expiry = userIsInCreativeMode()
  ? 60 * 60 * 1000  // 60 min for active design
  : 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 min for browsing

// Silent refresh preserving state
await refreshToken(); // No window reload
```

**Implementation Effort:** 8 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED

#### 2. Exposed Google OAuth Client ID in .env.production
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Location:** `.env.production:26`

**Exposed Credential:**
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=65518208813-9ipe2nakc6sind9tbdppl6kr3dnh2gjb.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

**Security Impact:**
- OAuth Client ID exposed in version control
- Public exposure risk if repository compromised
- Violation of credential management best practices

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Rotate Google OAuth credentials immediately
2. Remove `.env.production` from git tracking
3. Update `.gitignore` to prevent future commits
4. Use environment-specific secrets management

**Implementation Effort:** 4 hours
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE (gitignore updated, but file still tracked)

#### 3. XSS Vulnerabilities in 9 React Components
**Severity:** 🔴 HIGH
**Location:** Multiple files with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

**Vulnerable Files:**
- `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`
- `src/components/CollaborativeEditor.tsx:339`
- `src/components/MobileFirstLayout.tsx`
- `src/components/HomepageAuth.tsx`
- `src/components/MobileOptimizedHero.tsx`
- `src/components/LazyImage.tsx`
- `src/components/MobileOptimizedHeader.tsx`
- `src/pages/Login.tsx`
- `src/pages/Signup.tsx`

**Example Vulnerable Code:**
```typescript
// CollaborativeEditor.tsx:339
<div
  className="flex-1 p-6 text-white overflow-y-auto"
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: formatContent() }}
/>

const formatContent = () => {
  return content
    .replace(/^# (.*$)/gm, '<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">$1</h1>')
    .replace(/\*\*(.*?)\*\*/g, '<strong>$1</strong>')
    // NO SANITIZATION - DIRECT HTML INJECTION
};
```

**Security Impact:**
- User-controlled content can execute malicious scripts
- Potential for session hijacking
- Risk of credential theft
- Violates OWASP Top 10 (#3: Injection)

**Recommended Fix (with Creative Vision):**
```typescript
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

// Context-based sanitization preserving rich text
<div
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(formatContent(), {
      ALLOWED_TAGS: ['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'p', 'strong', 'em', 'u', 'a', 'blockquote'],
      ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href', 'title', 'target', 'rel']
    })
  }}
/>
```

**Implementation Effort:** 8 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED

### High Priority Security Issues (P1)

#### 4. No Multi-Factor Authentication
**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH
**Risk:** Account takeover via compromised passwords

**Current State:**
- Email/password authentication only
- Google OAuth (no MFA enforcement)
- No TOTP, SMS, or hardware key support

**Recommended Implementation:**
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) using speakeasy/otplib
- Backup codes (hashed, 10 codes)
- MFA enforcement for admin users
- Add `user_mfa` table with encrypted secrets

**Implementation Effort:** 16 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED

#### 5. Weak Password Policy
**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH
**Location:** `middleware/security.js:102-119`

**Current Policy:**
- Minimum 8 characters (weak)
- Uppercase + lowercase + number required
- No special character requirement
- No password complexity scoring
- No check against compromised passwords
- No prevention of password reuse

**Recommended Fix:**
- Increase minimum to 12 characters
- Require special character
- Implement zxcvbn strength checking (score >= 3)
- Add password history table (prevent last 5 passwords)

**Implementation Effort:** 6 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED

#### 6. Session Management Weaknesses
**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH
**Issues:**
- JWT stored in localStorage (vulnerable to XSS)
- No server-side session tracking
- No concurrent session limits
- No device fingerprinting
- No session invalidation on password change
- No "logout everywhere" functionality

**Recommended Fix:**
- Store tokens in httpOnly cookies (immune to XSS)
- Create `user_sessions` table for tracking
- Implement max 5 concurrent sessions per user
- Add session metadata (IP, user agent, device name)
- Implement `/api/auth/logout-all` endpoint

**Implementation Effort:** 12 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED

#### 7. Rate Limiting Uses In-Memory Store
**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH
**Location:** `middleware/security.js:14-31`

**Issues:**
- In-memory rate limiting resets on server restart
- No distributed rate limiting across instances
- Rate limits applied per IP only (bypassable)
- No user-based rate limiting
- No adaptive rate limiting

**Recommended Fix:**
```javascript
const RedisStore = require('rate-limit-redis');

const apiRateLimiter = rateLimit({
  store: new RedisStore({
    client: redisClient,
    prefix: 'rl:api:'
  }),
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100
});
```

**Implementation Effort:** 6 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED

### Medium Priority Security Issues (P2)

#### 8. WebSocket Authentication Weak
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Location:** `server-collaboration.js:78-98`

**Current Implementation:**
```javascript
wss.on('connection', (ws, req) => {
  // NO AUTHENTICATION CHECK
  const roomName = url.slice(1) || 'default';
  // Anyone can connect to any room
});
```

**Issues:**
- No JWT validation on WebSocket connections
- No room access control
- Any user can join any room (even private documents)
- No user identity verification

**Recommended Fix:**
```javascript
wss.on('connection', async (ws, req) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) {
    ws.close(1008, 'Authentication required');
    return;
  }

  const user = verifyToken(token);
  if (!user) {
    ws.close(1008, 'Invalid token');
    return;
  }

  const roomName = req.url.slice(1);
  if (!await hasRoomAccess(user.id, roomName)) {
    ws.close(1008, 'Access denied');
    return;
  }

  ws.userId = user.id;
  ws.userName = user.name;
});
```

**Implementation Effort:** 6 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED

#### 9. No Data Encryption at Rest
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Risk:** Database breach exposes all user data in plain text

**Current State:**
- PostgreSQL database stores data unencrypted
- File uploads stored unencrypted on disk
- No field-level encryption for PII

**Recommended Implementation:**
- Field-level encryption for PII using AES-256-GCM
- Enable PostgreSQL TDE or use RDS encryption
- Encrypt file uploads before storage

**Implementation Effort:** 16 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED

#### 10. PII Data Handling Non-Compliant (GDPR)
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Risk:** Legal compliance violations

**Gaps:**
- No data retention policy
- No automated data deletion
- No user data export functionality (Right to Access)
