**Risk 2: Load Testing Infrastructure Setup**
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Use k6 (simpler setup), cloud-based load generation
- **Contingency**: Use Artillery or JMeter as alternatives

**Risk 3: Figma Plugin API Limitations**
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Research API thoroughly, prototype early
