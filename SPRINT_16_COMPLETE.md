1. **Linear Regression** (weight: R-squared accuracy)
   - Best for: Consistent trends
   - Accuracy: Measured by R-squared
   - Output: Slope, intercept, predictions

2. **Exponential Smoothing** (weight: 0.7)
   - Best for: Seasonal data
   - Parameters: Alpha (smoothing factor)
   - Output: Level, trend, predictions

3. **Moving Average** (weight: 0.3)
   - Best for: Baseline comparison
   - Window: 7 days (configurable)
   - Output: Simple average

**Confidence Calculation**:
```typescript
confidence = accuracy * (1 - min(variance, 0.5))
confidence = max(0.5, min(1.0, confidence))
```

### Recommendation Engine Architecture

**Algorithms**:
1. **Content-Based Filtering**
   - Analyze file metadata (tags, category, type)
   - Calculate similarity scores
   - Recommend top N similar items

2. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - Analyze team behavior patterns
   - Find users with similar activities
   - Recommend items popular with similar users

3. **Feature Discovery**
   - Track feature usage
   - Identify unused features
   - Suggest relevant capabilities

**Scoring Formula**:
