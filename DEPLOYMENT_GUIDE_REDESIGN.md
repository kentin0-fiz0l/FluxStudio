## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can instantly rollback to legacy pages:

### Quick Rollback (No Code Changes)

**Option 1: Route Users to Legacy Pages**

Temporarily redirect main routes to legacy routes in nginx:

```nginx
location /organization {
  return 301 /organization/legacy;
}
location /team {
  return 301 /team/legacy;
}
location /file {
  return 301 /file/legacy;
}
location /messages {
  return 301 /messages/legacy;
}
```

**Option 2: Deploy Previous Build**

```bash
# Deploy previous build artifacts
ssh root@167.172.208.61 "cd /var/www/fluxstudio && \
  rm -rf build.new && \
  cp -r build build.new && \
  cp -r build.backup build && \
  pm2 restart fluxstudio"
```

### Full Rollback (Code Changes)

Edit `App.tsx` to use legacy components:

```tsx
// Change routes back to legacy
<Route path="/organization" element={<OrganizationPage />} />
<Route path="/team" element={<TeamPage />} />
<Route path="/file" element={<FilePage />} />
<Route path="/messages" element={<MessagesPage />} />
```

Then rebuild and redeploy.
