## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (45 minutes)

**Step 1: Google OAuth Rotation (30 min)**
```bash
# Follow guide: GOOGLE_OAUTH_ROTATION_GUIDE.md

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Delete old OAuth Client: 65518208813-9ipe2nakc6sind9tbdppl6kr3dnh2gjb
3. Create new OAuth 2.0 Client ID
4. Update .env.production:
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=[NEW_CLIENT_ID]
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=[NEW_CLIENT_SECRET]
```

**Step 2: Git History Cleanup (15 min)**
```bash
# COORDINATE WITH TEAM FIRST!

# Run cleanup script
./scripts/remove-env-from-git.sh

# Verify secrets removed
git log --all --full-history -S 'JWT_SECRET' -- .

# Force push
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags

# Team members must reset:
git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/master
```

### Phase 2: Database Migration (5 minutes)

```bash
# Connect to production database
ssh root@167.172.208.61

# Run migration
cd /var/www/fluxstudio
psql -d fluxstudio -f database/migrations/001_create_refresh_tokens.sql

# Verify table created
psql -d fluxstudio -c "\d refresh_tokens"
```

### Phase 3: Code Deployment (30 minutes)

```bash
# On local machine
cd /Users/kentino/FluxStudio

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to server
npm run deploy

# Or manual deployment:
rsync -avz --exclude=node_modules ./ root@167.172.208.61:/var/www/fluxstudio/
```

### Phase 4: Server Configuration (15 minutes)

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh root@167.172.208.61
cd /var/www/fluxstudio

# Install dependencies
npm install --production

# Update server-auth.js to import new modules
# (See integration guide in JWT_REFRESH_TOKENS_COMPLETE.md)

# Restart services
pm2 restart all

# Verify services running
pm2 status
pm2 logs --lines 50
```

### Phase 5: Verification (15 minutes)

```bash
# Test authentication endpoints
curl -X POST https://fluxstudio.art/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@fluxstudio.art","password":"test123"}'

# Test refresh endpoint
curl -X POST https://fluxstudio.art/api/auth/refresh \

  -d '{"refreshToken":"<TOKEN>"}'

# Test sessions endpoint
curl -X GET https://fluxstudio.art/api/auth/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"

# Check security headers
curl -I https://fluxstudio.art

# Verify CSP header present
