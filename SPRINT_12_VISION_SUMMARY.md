# Sprint 12 Vision Summary: Quick Reference

**For:** All FluxStudio agents
**From:** Creative Director
**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved with Recommendations
**Full Brief:** [SPRINT_12_VISION_BRIEF.md](/Users/kentino/FluxStudio/SPRINT_12_VISION_BRIEF.md)

## Core Vision Statement

**Sprint 12 Theme:** Security as Creative Enabler

Security hardening and architecture refactoring must be **invisible enablers** of creative flow. Users should notice improved trust and performance, not technical operations.

---

## Priority Alignment Scores

| Priority | Score | Key Concern |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| JWT Token Refresh | ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional | 15-min expiry too aggressive for creative sessions |
| Mobile Keyboard | ‚úÖ Strong | Direct creative flow enhancement |
| Skip Navigation | ‚úÖ Strong | Elevates keyboard user experience |
| Server Refactoring | ‚úÖ Strong | Enables future creative features |
| XSS Protection | ‚úÖ Strong | Trust without restricting expression |

---

## Critical Requirements (Must Implement)

### 1. Token Refresh Intelligence
```typescript
// DON'T: Rigid 15-minute expiry
const expiry = 15 * 60 * 1000;

// DO: Activity-based extension
const expiry = userIsInCreativeMode()
  ? 60 * 60 * 1000  // 60 min for active design
  : 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 min for browsing
```

### 2. No Window Reloads on Refresh
```typescript
// DON'T: Disruptive reload
window.location.reload();

// DO: Silent refresh preserving state
await refreshToken(); // No UI change
```

### 3. Warnings Only at Pause Points
- Never show warnings during active canvas editing
- Never show warnings during voice/video collaboration
- Queue for natural pauses (save actions, tool switches)

### 4. Phased Rollout with Rollback
- Deploy with feature flags
- Run old/new code in parallel
- One-click rollback capability
- Deploy during low-usage windows

### 5. Rich Text Preservation
```typescript
// DON'T: Strip all HTML
DOMPurify.sanitize(input, { ALLOWED_TAGS: [] });

// DO: Context-based sanitization
DOMPurify.sanitize(input, {
  ALLOWED_TAGS: ['strong', 'em', 'u', 'a', 'blockquote'],
  ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href', 'title']
});
```

## Success Metrics (Vision Lens)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Session Continuity | 99.5% | Creative flow uninterrupted |
| Mobile Form Completion | 85% | Mobile creative parity |
| User Sentiment: "Faster" | 15%+ | Invisible performance gains |
| Skip Navigation Usage | 20%+ | Keyboard power users delighted |
| Production Rollbacks | 0 | Deployment confidence |

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Security Theater
Don't create visible security measures that annoy without improving security.

**Example:** Frequent re-authentication during active sessions

### ‚ùå Technical Jargon
Don't expose implementation details to users.

**Bad:** "JWT token expired"
**Good:** "Your session has expired"

### ‚ùå Interrupting Creative Flow
Don't force security decisions during immersive creative states.

**Example:** Session timeout warning during active canvas editing

### ‚ùå One-Size-Fits-All
Don't treat all actions with same security rigor.

**Example:** Requiring authentication to view public portfolio

### ‚ùå Over-Sanitization
Don't strip useful formatting in pursuit of security.

**Example:** Removing all links from design feedback comments

---

## Vision-Fit Quick Check

Before implementing any feature, ask:

1. **Collaborative Momentum:** Does this make real-time creation easier?
2. **Unified Process:** Does this honor art/design/code as one process?
3. **Effortlessness:** Does the platform disappear during creation?
4. **Expressiveness:** Does this expand creative vocabulary?
5. **Aliveness:** Does this feel immediate and responsive?

**If any answer is NO, redesign or escalate to Creative Director.**

## Agent-Specific Directives

### flux-studio-pm
- Prioritize zero-disruption over aggressive timelines
- Extend to 12 days if needed for quality
- Schedule deployments during low-usage windows

### tech-lead-orchestrator
- Implement feature flags for all refactoring
- Run old/new code in parallel
- Measure creative workflow performance before/after
- Token refresh must support activity-based extension

### ux-reviewer
- Review all security messaging for jargon
- Test warnings during active design workflows
- Validate mobile keyboard in annotation context
- Ensure skip targets are workflow-specific

### code-reviewer
- Test coverage for token refresh edge cases
- Validate XSS preserves rich text formatting
- Ensure storage refactor maintains upload speed
- Review rollback strategy for every change

### security-reviewer
- Balance 15-min expiry with activity extension
- Implement tiered XSS sanitization
- Enable multi-device workflows
- Frame security as trust signals, not warnings

---

## Recommended Enhancements

### Workflow-Specific Skip Links
Different skip targets based on context (design workspace vs project management)

### Keyboard Shortcut Legend
Press "?" to see all keyboard shortcuts

### Mobile Canvas Annotations
Extend keyboard-aware forms to design annotation tools

### Haptic Feedback
Subtle haptic on mobile form submission, file upload, comment post

### Multi-Device Token Sync
Use BroadcastChannel API to sync tokens across tabs/devices

---

## Red Flags (Escalate Immediately)

üö® **User reports "lost work due to session expiry"**
üö® **Session timeout warning during active canvas editing**
üö® **Mobile users can't reach submit buttons**
üö® **Refactoring causes production rollback**
üö® **XSS sanitization strips designer comments**
üö® **Performance degrades after deployment**
üö® **Users report "platform feels slow"**

---

## Vision Stewardship Commitment

Creative Director will:
- Review implementation progress weekly (Mondays)
- Monitor user feedback for flow disruptions
- Mediate security vs. usability discussions
- Conduct post-sprint vision audit

---

## Final Approval Status

**‚úÖ APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS**

Sprint 12 strongly aligns with creative vision. Implement critical requirements, monitor success metrics, avoid anti-patterns, and escalate red flags immediately.

**Next Review:** Day 5 (mid-sprint checkpoint)
