## Epic 1: Design System Consolidation

**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Effort:** 40 hours
**Sprint:** Sprint 14 (Week 3)
**Owner:** Code Simplifier + Tech Lead

### Problem Statement

FluxStudio currently has multiple conflicting design systems:
- Legacy gradient colors (yellow, pink, purple, cyan, green)
- Sidebar color tokens (hsl CSS variables)
- Neutral colors (50-950 scale)
- Multiple font families (Outfit, Inter, Sora)
- Inconsistent spacing and shadow values

This creates:
- Visual inconsistency across pages
- Increased CSS bundle size (duplication)
- Maintenance burden (changes in multiple places)
- Designer/developer friction (unclear which tokens to use)

### Objectives

1. **Single Color System**: Consolidate to one color palette
2. **Single Font System**: Reduce to 1-2 font families
3. **Token-based Spacing**: Replace hardcoded values with tokens
4. **Unified Shadows**: Standardize elevation system
5. **Dark Mode Optimization**: Ensure tokens work in both themes

## Epic 4: OAuth Sync Status Visibility

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Effort:** 10 hours
**Sprint:** Sprint 15 (Week 4)
**Owner:** Tech Lead + UX Reviewer

### Problem Statement

Users have no visibility into OAuth sync status:
- No indication if connection is active/inactive
- No feedback when sync fails
- No way to know when last sync occurred
- No clear path to reconnect after token expiration

This creates:

## Dependencies & Critical Path

### Dependency Graph

```
Sprint 14 (Week 3):
  Epic 1 (Design System):
    Task 1.1 (Audit) â†’ Task 1.2 (Tokens) â†’ Task 1.3 (Tailwind) â†’ Task 1.4 (Migrate)

  Epic 2 (Visual Complexity):
    Task 2.1 (Audit) â†’ Task 2.2 (Gradients)
                     â†’ Task 2.3 (Blur)
                     â†’ Task 2.4 (Hierarchy)

  Epic 3 (Skeletons):
    Task 3.1 (Components) â†’ Task 3.2 (Integrate) â†’ Task 3.3 (Accessibility)

Sprint 15 (Week 4):
  Epic 4 (OAuth Status):
    Task 4.1 (Component) â†’ Task 4.2 (API) â†’ Task 4.3 (Notifications)

  Epic 5 (Bulk Actions):
    Task 5.1 (Multi-select) â†’ Task 5.2 (Toolbar) â†’ Task 5.3 (API)

  Epic 6 (Backend Fixes):
    Task 6.1 (Messaging) â†’ Task 6.2 (Collaboration)
```

### Critical Path

**Longest path (design system consolidation):**
Task 1.1 (8h) â†’ Task 1.2 (12h) â†’ Task 1.3 (6h) â†’ Task 1.4 (14h) = **40 hours**

This is the bottleneck for Sprint 14. Other work can proceed in parallel.

### Parallel Work Opportunities

**Sprint 14:**
- Epic 1 (Design System) + Epic 3 (Skeletons) can run in parallel
- Epic 2 (Visual Complexity) depends on Epic 1 completion

**Sprint 15:**
- Epic 4, 5, 6 can all run in parallel (no dependencies between them)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

#### Risk 1: Design System Migration Breaking Changes
**Probability:** HIGH
**Impact:** HIGH
**Mitigation:**
- Thorough visual regression testing
- Gradual rollout (component-by-component)
- Maintain legacy tokens temporarily for rollback
- Designer sign-off at each milestone

#### Risk 2: Backend Services Have Fundamental Issues
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH (blocks production deployment)
**Mitigation:**
- Start Epic 6 early (Week 4 Day 1)
- Allocate extra time buffer (8 hours)
- Have infrastructure team on standby
- Consider third-party WebSocket service if unfixable

#### Risk 3: Scope Creep During Implementation
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Strict adherence to task definitions
- Defer "nice-to-haves" to Phase 3
- Time-box all tasks (hard stop at estimated hours)
- Tech Lead approval required for scope changes

### Medium Risks

#### Risk 4: Designer Approval Delays
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Get designer buy-in early (before Sprint 14)
- Schedule daily design review meetings
- Provide interactive prototypes, not just screenshots
- Have fallback plan (Tech Lead makes call if designer unavailable)

#### Risk 5: OAuth API Doesn't Expose Status
**Probability:** LOW
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Verify API capabilities before Epic 4
- If missing, implement client-side status tracking
- Defer real-time updates if WebSocket unavailable

### Low Risks

#### Risk 6: Skeleton Animations Affect Performance
**Probability:** LOW
**Impact:** LOW
**Mitigation:**
- Use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated)
- Test on low-end devices early
- Disable animations on low-performance devices
- Add prefers-reduced-motion support

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 2 Rollout Strategy

**Option A: Big Bang (Not Recommended)**
- Deploy all Phase 2 changes at once
- High risk (many changes at once)
- Difficult to isolate issues

**Option B: Incremental Rollout (Recommended)**
1. **Week 3 (Sprint 14):**
   - Deploy design system consolidation (Day 3)
   - Deploy visual complexity reduction (Day 4)
   - Deploy skeleton loading screens (Day 5)

2. **Week 4 (Sprint 15):**
   - Deploy OAuth sync status (Day 2)
   - Deploy bulk message actions (Day 3)
   - Deploy backend service fixes (Day 4)

3. **Monitoring Period:**
   - Monitor for 2-3 days after each deploy
   - Fix critical issues immediately
   - Defer minor issues to next sprint

**Option C: Feature Flags (Best)**
- Deploy all changes behind feature flags
- Enable for internal team first (dogfooding)
- Enable for beta users (5% of users)
- Enable for all users after 1 week of stability
- Allows for instant rollback without redeployment

### Rollback Plan

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Critical bug affecting >10% of users
- WCAG compliance violation
- Performance regression >20%
- Security vulnerability discovered

**Rollback Procedure:**
1. Disable feature flag (if using Option C)
2. Or: Revert git commit and redeploy
3. Alert users of temporary unavailability
4. Debug issue in development environment
5. Fix and re-test before re-enable
6. Communicate fix to users
