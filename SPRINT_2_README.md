## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Where do I start coding?**
A: Read SPRINT_2_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, then start with Day 1 task (TaskListView component).

**Q: What if I'm blocked?**
A: Post in #dev-help Slack channel, or raise in daily standup. Tech Lead available for guidance.

**Q: Can I change the technical approach?**
A: Discuss with Tech Lead first. We've chosen libraries for specific reasons (accessibility, performance).

**Q: What if Sprint 1 API isn't ready?**
A: We can work with mock data for Week 1, but need real API by Week 2 for WebSocket integration.

**Q: Is the timeline realistic?**
A: Yes, we've scoped carefully. P1/P2 features are achievable, P3 features are "nice-to-have" and can be deferred.

**Q: How do I handle accessibility?**
A: Follow patterns in existing components (ProjectDetail.tsx). Use ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management.

**Q: What about security?**
A: All input is validated on both client and server. Use DOMPurify for XSS prevention. Never trust client data.
