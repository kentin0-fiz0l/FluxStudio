# Starspot: Cross‑Disciplinary Creative Collaboration Platform

FluxStudio’s success for marching arts designers inspired us to broaden the vision. Starspot expands the core platform into a versatile creative‑collaboration hub for any discipline—music ensembles, film production, graphic design, advertising, architecture and beyond. It builds on the foundations of FluxStudio while addressing new requirements and improving infrastructure.

## Vision
Starspot aims to empower creative teams by combining real‑time co‑editing, version control, AI assistance and robust project management in a single responsive web platform hosted on DigitalOcean.

## Key Improvements from FluxStudio
- **DigitalOcean‑native infrastructure**: Uses DigitalOcean App Platform for hosting and Spaces for file storage. Environment variables are updated to reference DigitalOcean keys and regions. Example:  
  - `DO_SPACES_KEY`, `DO_SPACES_SECRET`, `DO_SPACES_REGION`, `DO_SPACES_BUCKET`  
- **Real‑time co‑editing with version control**: Incorporates a CRDT‑based editor (e.g. Yjs or Yrs) to allow simultaneous editing while supporting branching, merging and history playback. Private drafts can be merged back into the main design to avoid the “fishbowl” effect.  
- **AI‑powered assistants**:  
  - *Design Assistant* for generating wireframes, layout suggestions and asset organisation.  
  - *Developer Assistant* for code scaffolding, documentation, refactoring and automated testing.  
  - Future *Producer Assistant* for scheduling, budgeting and resource planning.  
- **Multi‑agent collaboration**: Agents can work concurrently on separate branches or files, coordinated through pull requests and role assignments. Guidelines in `docs/multi-agent-collaboration.md` describe best practices for branching and reviews.  
- **Enhanced documentation**: Expands the README and docs to cover new environment variables, deployment instructions for DigitalOcean, architecture diagrams and contribution guidelines.  
- **Security and compliance**: Adds sections on password policies, rate limiting, secret management and data privacy. Plans for SSO, audit trails and compliance with GDPR and SOC 2.  
- **Accessibility and domain extensibility**: Ensures WCAG compliance and offers modular plugin architecture so new domains (e.g., storyboarding, video editing) can add custom tools.  

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository and run `npm install`.  
2. Set up a PostgreSQL database and configure the environment variables using `.env.do.example`.  
3. Start the development servers with `npm run dev` and `node server-production.js`.  
4. Review the updated `README.md` for DigitalOcean deployment instructions.  

## Future Work
The Starspot roadmap includes:  
- Complete integration of Yjs‑based co‑editing across all design canvases.  
- AI prototypes for design generation and predictive analytics.  
- Native mobile applications for iOS and Android with offline editing.  
- Marketplace for user‑generated templates and plugins.
