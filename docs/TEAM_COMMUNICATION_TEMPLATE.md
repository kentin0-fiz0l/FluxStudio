# Team Communication Templates - Git History Cleanup

## Template 1: Pre-Cleanup Announcement (24 hours before)

**Subject**: üö® URGENT: Git History Rewrite Scheduled - Action Required

**To**: All Development Team Members

**Priority**: HIGH

---

**Team,**

We have identified a security issue that requires rewriting our git repository history. Production credentials were accidentally committed and must be removed.

### What's Happening

- **Issue**: `.env.production` file containing production credentials was committed to git history
- **Impact**: Database passwords, JWT secrets, OAuth credentials, and API keys were exposed
- **Action**: Complete git history rewrite to remove all traces of sensitive files
- **Timeline**: Scheduled for **[DATE] at [TIME]**

### Immediate Actions Required

**BEFORE [DATE] at [TIME - 1 HOUR]:**

1. ‚úÖ **COMMIT AND PUSH** all your work
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Pre-history-rewrite commit"
   git push origin [your-branch]
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **REPLY TO THIS EMAIL** confirming you've pushed all work

3. ‚úÖ **PAUSE DEVELOPMENT** after [TIME - 30 MIN]
   - Do NOT start new work
   - Do NOT push any commits after the pause time

4. ‚úÖ **WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION** email before resuming work

### Timeline

| Time | Event | Action Required |
|------|-------|----------------|
| [TIME - 24h] | This announcement | Acknowledge receipt |
| [TIME - 4h] | Second reminder | Confirm work is committed |
| [TIME - 1h] | Final warning | Push all work |
| [TIME - 30m] | **DEVELOPMENT FREEZE** | Stop all git operations |
| [TIME] | History rewrite begins | Wait for updates |
| [TIME + 30m] | Rewrite complete | Follow sync instructions |
| [TIME + 1h] | Development resumes | Normal work continues |

### What NOT to Do

- ‚ùå Do NOT force push anything
- ‚ùå Do NOT create new branches after freeze time
- ‚ùå Do NOT try to pull/merge during the rewrite
- ‚ùå Do NOT panic - we have full backups

### Why This Is Critical

Git history rewrites change all commit SHAs. If you don't sync properly:
- Your local repository will be out of sync
- You won't be able to push or pull
- You'll need to re-clone or reset

## Template 3: Rewrite Complete - Sync Instructions

**Subject**: ‚úÖ Git History Rewrite Complete - Sync Your Repository NOW

**To**: All Development Team Members

**Priority**: HIGH

---

**Team,**

The git history rewrite is complete. You must sync your local repository before resuming work.

### Verification First

The rewrite was successful:
- ‚úÖ `.env.production` removed from all commits
- ‚úÖ All credentials have been rotated
- ‚úÖ Repository integrity verified
- ‚úÖ Changes pushed to remote

### Required Actions (Choose One)

### **Option 1: Reset Local Repository (Recommended - Faster)**

Use this if you've already pushed all your work.

```bash
# 1. Save any uncommitted work (if you have any)
cd /Users/[your-username]/FluxStudio
git stash save "Pre-sync-backup"

# 2. Fetch the new history
git fetch --all

# 3. Hard reset to remote (DESTRUCTIVE)
git reset --hard origin/master

# 4. Clean leftover files
git clean -fdx

# 5. Verify sync
git log --oneline -5

# 6. Restore stashed work (if applicable)
git stash list
git stash pop

# 7. Reinstall dependencies (if needed)
npm install
```

### **Option 2: Fresh Clone (Safest)**

Use this if you're unsure or want a clean start.

```bash
# 1. Back up your current directory
cd /Users/[your-username]
mv FluxStudio FluxStudio.old

# 2. Clone fresh copy
git clone [REPO_URL] FluxStudio
cd FluxStudio

# 3. Copy local config (if you have it)
cp ../FluxStudio.old/.env.local .env.local

# 4. Install dependencies
npm install

# 5. Test the application
npm test

# 6. Once confirmed working, remove backup
rm -rf FluxStudio.old
```

### Verification Steps

After syncing, verify everything is correct:

```bash
# 1. Verify .env.production is not in history
git log --all --full-history --oneline -- .env.production
# Expected: Empty output or error

# 2. Check your current branch
git branch

# 3. Check remote sync
git status
# Expected: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'"

# 4. Run tests
npm test
# Expected: All tests pass
```

### New Credentials

Production credentials have been rotated. If you need access:

1. Contact [SECURITY LEAD] for new `.env.production`
2. **DO NOT** commit this file
3. Pre-commit hook is now installed to prevent this

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories`
```bash
# Solution: Use Option 2 (fresh clone) instead
```

**Issue**: `error: Your local changes would be overwritten`
```bash
# Solution: Stash your changes first
git stash save "my-changes"
git reset --hard origin/master
git stash pop
```

**Issue**: `Cannot push my changes`
```bash
# Solution: Your changes are based on old history
# Create a patch and apply to new history:
git diff > my-changes.patch
git reset --hard origin/master
git apply my-changes.patch
```

**Issue**: Pre-commit hook blocks my commit
```bash
# Good! It's working. Remove sensitive files:
git reset HEAD .env.production
# Add to .gitignore if not already there
```

### Open Pull Requests

If you have open PRs, they will need to be recreated:

1. Save your branch changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git diff master > feature-changes.patch
   ```

2. Sync with new history (use Option 1 or 2 above)

3. Create new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch-v2
   git apply feature-changes.patch
   git push -u origin your-feature-branch-v2
   ```

4. Close old PR and create new one

## Template 5: All Clear - Resume Development

**Subject**: ‚úÖ All Clear - Normal Development Resumed

**To**: All Development Team Members

---

**Team,**

Excellent work! The git history cleanup is complete and all team members have synced.

### Summary

- ‚úÖ All sensitive credentials removed from git history
- ‚úÖ All credentials rotated and secured
- ‚úÖ All team members synced and verified
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks installed to prevent future issues
- ‚úÖ Repository integrity confirmed

### Development Status

**Normal development has resumed.**

You can now:
- Create branches
- Commit changes
- Push to remote
- Create pull requests
- Merge code

### New Security Measures

We've implemented several improvements:

1. **Pre-commit hook**: Automatically blocks committing sensitive files
   - Located: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
   - Test it: Try to commit `.env.production` (it should block)

2. **Updated .gitignore**: More comprehensive patterns

3. **Documentation**: See `docs/GIT_HISTORY_CLEANUP.md`

4. **Credential rotation**: All production secrets updated

### Best Practices Reminder

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Use `.env.local` for local development
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for all secrets
- ‚úÖ Commit `.env.example` with dummy values
- ‚úÖ Add sensitive files to `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Review staged changes before committing

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Commit `.env.production` or any file with real credentials
- ‚ùå Hardcode API keys or passwords in code
- ‚ùå Use `--no-verify` to bypass pre-commit hooks
- ‚ùå Share credentials via email or Slack
- ‚ùå Store credentials in comments or documentation

### Testing the Pre-Commit Hook

Try this to verify the hook works:

```bash
# This should be blocked
git add .env.production
git commit -m "Test"
# Expected: Error message and commit blocked

# Reset if it worked
git reset HEAD .env.production
```

### What If I Need to Commit an Environment File?

**Short answer**: You don't. Never commit actual credentials.

**Instead**:
1. Create `.env.example` with placeholder values
2. Document required variables in README
3. Share actual credentials via secure channel (1Password, AWS Secrets, etc.)

### Lessons Learned

This incident reminds us:
- Git history is permanent (even if we rewrite it)
- Assume committed secrets are compromised
- Prevention is better than cleanup
- Team coordination is critical for security

### Post-Incident Review

We'll hold a retrospective:
- **When**: [DATE and TIME]
- **Where**: [LOCATION/ZOOM LINK]
- **Agenda**: What went well, what to improve, action items

Optional but encouraged for all team members.

### Questions?

If you have any questions about the new security measures or best practices:
- Documentation: `docs/GIT_HISTORY_CLEANUP.md`
- Slack: #security-questions
- Email: [SECURITY TEAM EMAIL]

**Subject**: Security Incident Report - Exposed Credentials in Git History

**To**: Security Team, Management

**Classification**: Internal - Security Incident

---

### Incident Summary

**Date Discovered**: [DATE]
**Date Resolved**: [DATE]
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Resolved

### Description

Production credentials were accidentally committed to git repository history in file `.env.production`.

### Exposed Information

- Database passwords (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- JWT secrets (JWT_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET)
- OAuth client secrets (Google, GitHub)
- SMTP credentials
- Grafana admin passwords
- API keys (OpenAI, Stripe, third-party services)

### Root Cause

Developer committed `.env.production` file to repository in commit `398c28746eea1ae2bbcd7d37ed3fe5527c56ebeb` on October 11, 2025.

Contributing factors:
1. `.env.production` was not in `.gitignore` at time of commit
2. No pre-commit hook to prevent sensitive file commits
3. No credential scanning in CI/CD pipeline
4. Developer unfamiliar with security best practices

### Impact Assessment

**Confidentiality**: HIGH
- All production credentials exposed in git history
- Git history is distributed (copies may exist locally)

**Integrity**: LOW
- No evidence of credential misuse
- No unauthorized access detected

**Availability**: NONE
- No service disruption

**Risk Level**: HIGH (due to wide exposure potential)

### Immediate Response

**Timeline**:
