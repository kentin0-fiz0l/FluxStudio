## üèÜ Key Innovations

### 1. Creative Flow-Aware Authentication

**First authentication system designed specifically for creative workflows.**

**Problem:** Traditional 7-day token expiry logs out users during active work sessions.

**Solution:** Activity-based token extension
- Active users (within last hour) get automatic 7-day extension
- Continuous extension as long as user is actively working
- Inactive users require re-authentication after 7 days

**Result:** Users never logged out during creative sessions, but security maintained for inactive accounts.

### 2. Context-Aware Sanitization

**18 different sanitization functions for different contexts.**

**Contexts Supported:**
- Plain text (usernames, titles)
- Rich text (blog posts, descriptions)
- Comments (user feedback)
- URLs (links, references)
- Filenames (uploads, downloads)
- Emails (contact forms)
- JSON (API responses)
- Markdown (future support)

**Benefit:** More secure than one-size-fits-all approach. Each context gets appropriate level of sanitization.

### 3. Privacy-Preserving Fingerprinting

**Device fingerprinting that respects user privacy.**

**Privacy Measures:**
- IP subnets only (not full IPs)
  - IPv4: /24 subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
  - IPv6: /64 subnet
- SHA-256 hashing (irreversible)
- No tracking across sites
- Fuzzy matching for minor changes

**Security Benefits:**
- Detect token theft across devices
- Track suspicious patterns
- Multi-device session management
